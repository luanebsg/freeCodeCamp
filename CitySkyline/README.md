# City Skyline Project

## Overview

This project is a visual representation of a city skyline, created as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. It showcases various CSS techniques and principles, including the use of CSS variables, flexbox for layout, complex selectors, and media queries for responsive design. The skyline features a dynamic background that changes colors and building appearances based on the viewport width, thanks to CSS media queries.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Features

- A vibrant city skyline with multiple buildings of different sizes and shapes.
- Dynamic window and building colors that change under certain conditions using CSS variables.
- A responsive design that alters the color scheme of the skyline when the viewport width is 1000px or less, enhancing the visual experience on different devices.

## Setup

To view this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How It Works

The project utilizes HTML and CSS to create the visual representation of a city skyline. HTML div elements are used to construct the buildings, with CSS classes applied to style and position them. CSS variables define the colors of the buildings and windows, which can be easily modified for different themes or times of day.

CSS flexbox is employed to align and distribute the buildings within the skyline, ensuring a cohesive layout. Media queries are used to change the color scheme when the viewport width falls below 1000px, simulating a night-time scene.

## Challenges Faced

The implementation of this project involved several challenges, including:

- Learning to use CSS variables for the first time to streamline the color scheme modifications.
- Mastering CSS flexbox to achieve the desired layout of the buildings.
- Employing media queries to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Lessons Learned

Through the completion of the City Skyline project, I gained valuable experience in:

- Advanced CSS techniques and their practical applications.
- The importance of responsive design in modern web development.
- How to effectively use documentation and online resources to solve coding challenges.
